    """Middleware to add a unique request ID to each request.

    This middleware extracts or generates a unique request ID for each incoming
    request, stores it in a context variable for use throughout the request
    lifecycle, and adds it to the response headers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    request : Request
        The incoming FastAPI request object containing headers and other
        request information.
    call_next : Callable[[Request], Awaitable[Response]]
        The next middleware or route handler in the FastAPI middleware chain.
        This function will be called to continue processing the request.

    Returns
    -------
    Response
        The response from the next middleware/handler with the X-Request-Id
        header added. If the request already had an X-Request-Id header, that
        value is used; otherwise, a new UUID is generated.

    Notes
    -----
    The request ID is stored in a context variable (request_id_ctx) which can
    be accessed from anywhere within the same request context, including
    exception handlers and other middleware.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # This middleware is automatically applied by FastAPI
    >>> # The request ID will be available in response headers
    >>> response.headers["X-Request-Id"]
    '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
    """
